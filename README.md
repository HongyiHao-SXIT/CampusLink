# **CampusLink App**

## **Introduction**

**CampusLink** is a campus-oriented social connection and information-sharing platform inspired by the well-known application **Wuke Fenggao**, which was developed by a team led by **Taira He** from the IEEE Class at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University**.

The purpose of CampusLink is to provide university students with a lightweight, fast, and intuitive way to communicate anonymously or publicly, share resources, exchange academic information, and build a more connected campus community.
It aims to bridge the gap between students by offering a modern, simple, and privacy-friendly interaction environment.
